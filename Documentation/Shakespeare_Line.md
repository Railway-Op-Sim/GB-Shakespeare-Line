# Shakespeare Line

The Shakespeare Line (normally known as the North Warwickshire Line) is named after the southern terminus Stratford-upon-Avon - the birthplace of William Shakespeare.

The line runs south from Birmingham Moor Street, diverging from the Chiltern Main Line at Tyseley, to Stratford-upon-Avon. Trains used to continue on the Honeybourne Line to Honeybourne, and on to Cardiff. The line south of Stratford-upon-Avon is now closed, however some has been retained as the Gloucestershire and Warwickshire Railway. As such, Stratford-upon-Avon is now a terminus station.

Also included in this simulation is the Chiltern Main Line via Dorridge to Hatton, and the Leamington - Stratford Line connecting the two.

Services on the Shakespeare Line today, as well as to Stratford-upon-Avon via Dorridge, are operated by West Midlands Railway using Class 172 DMUs. Services to London Marylebone on the Chiltern Main Line are operated by Chiltern Railways using mainly Class 168s, with some services operated by Class 68s and Mark 3 carriages. Services from Leamington to Stratford-upon-Avon and Birmingham are also operated by Chiltern Railways, mainly using Class 165s. West Midlands Railway also operate a couple of services to Leamington Spa each day.

## Operational Tips

- Be careful not to set routes too early - trains can travel long distances in relatively short times.
- At the Birmingham exit, the bottom pair of lines goes to Birmingham Moor Street while the top pair goes to Landor St Junction for Birmingham New Street. All Chiltern and West Midlands Railway services go to Birmingham Moor Street, while CrossCountry services head to Landor St Junction.
- Freight services typically go to Landor St Junction, but 6V34 instead heads to Birmingham Moor Street.
- Keep an eye on instructions for freight trains, some southbound services use the Down Loop at Dorridge instead of the more usual Up Loop.
- Keep an eye on instructions for trains departing Stratford-upon-Avon - 2Vxx services run via Dorridge most the day, but in the evening switch to running via Whitlocks End.
- Trains terminating at Dorridge should use the loop platform, as this is the only bi-directional platform.
